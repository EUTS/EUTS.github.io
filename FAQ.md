###Frequently Asked Questions

####1) What are Github Pages and how do you create them?

Github pages are public webpages that are freely hosted and easily published through the Git site. Setting up your Github page is extremely easy. Begin by creating a new repository, and then naming the repository <I>username</I>.github.io, where <I>username</I> is your username (or organization) on Github.You then need to add an index.html file and you're ready to go. For more visual instructions, visit [this](https://pages.github.com) site. 

####2) What is Jekyll and Bootstrap?

All Github Pages, including this one, use Jekyll as it's engine. Jekyll allows you to create and deploy static websites as quickly and easily as possible. The best thing about Jekyll is that development can be done directly from your local computer (that is why we're using it!)

Bootstrap is a collecion of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS based design templates for text, form, buttons, navigation and other componenets. Bootstrap can be used to add HTML and CSS code to your Jekyll pages. If you want to learn more about the benefits of Jekyll Blogs, click [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com).
