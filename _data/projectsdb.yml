  description: Sample project that can be further improved, which is an implementation of a packet analyzer. A packet analyzer (sniffer) is a program that intercepts the traffic passing through a network interface. In this project, we are going to implement our own packet sniffer using the libpcap library and to validate our program on actual network traffic.
