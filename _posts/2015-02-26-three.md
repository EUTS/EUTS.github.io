Introduction:

For those of you who are wondering, [overthewire.org](https://www.overthewire.org)  is a website that is dedicated to helping you learn and practice security concepts in the form of “games”. These games usually involve “hacking” into their servers and retrieving the password for the next level. I put hacking in quotations because you’re not really hacking, but you feel like you are, therefore the challenge name: Feel Like a Hacker. <br>


For this week’s challenge and the next, we’re going to be attempting levels 5 onwards of their game called Bandit. (Levels 0 - 4 were covered in our first challenge. You can find the link [here](http://euts.github.io/challenges/one/)) <br>


The purpose of these “hacking” challenges are:

- To get you comfortable with using the command line <br>
- To help you learn some security concepts <br>
- To feel accomplished <br>
- To have fun! <br>


Challenge:

- Go to levels <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html">5</a> and <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html">6</a> for Bandit and read the instructions on the side. 
- Use google to look up what each of the following commands do:
ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep or you can click <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal2">here</a>. 
                               

- Use the information you gain to find the password for levels 6 and 7.
- Send a screenshot of your command line + the passwords to <a href="mailto:eutechsociety@effat.edu.sa">eutechsociety@effat.edu.sa </a>

Some notes: 

- We’re going to be announcing the solution for “Feel Like a Hacker” this weekend, inshaAllah. 


- If you’re new to this type of challenge, first try out our first challenge [“Feel Like a Hacker”](http://euts.github.io/challenges/one/) where we show you how to access the Bandit server using secure shell. 


- If you were looking forward to the second part of the web development challenge, we apologize. InshaAllah, once we’re done with a month of challenges and the winner is announced, we’ll get back to the web development stuff. :D
