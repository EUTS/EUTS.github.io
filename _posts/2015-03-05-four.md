By now, you should be familiar with using the command line so I’m going to jump straight to the challenge! 
<br>

Ze Challenge:


- Solve level 6 on bandit at [overthewire.org](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html)

- Send us the screenshot of your command line + the password of level 7! 

<h3 style="text-align:center">Congratulations!</h3>
<br>You’ve finished a month of the Hacker challenges. If you’ve come this far, you can pat yourself on the back. :p 

Also, for a little reward:

Do you like keyboard mashups? Do you want to know what real hacking looks like: Check out [Geektype](http://geektyper.com), a website made as a practical joke! 

(Disclaimer: the website doesn't teach you real hacking, it’s just a joke which you can use to fool your friends into thinking you’re hacking)
