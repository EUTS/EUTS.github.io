##Challenge aim: Make an online portfolio using HTML and CSS. 

###Description: 

<br>
This week, the challenge is to make the landing page of your portfolio. A landing page looks something like this: 

<div class="col">
              <ul class="list-inline intro-social-buttons text-center">
                       <img src="/img/challenges/landing-page.jpg" alt="Smiley face" align="middle" class="img-responsive" > 
               </ul>
  </div>

<br>

Things to include on your page:

- A background image 
- Your name
- A line that introduces you 
- Some links to your social media accounts 

Once you've written your code, do the following:

- Step one: Name your file index.html
- Step two: Host the file online and send us the online link. 
 
 <br>
One way you can host your website online is by using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com) The only thing you need is a Github account. If you donâ€™t already have one, make one at www.github.com.
